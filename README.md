# Welcome to my JavaScript Practices!
In this repository, you will find a collection of personal JavaScript practice exercises and solutions. These exercises was to help me improve my understanding and skills in working with JavaScript.

Each exercise includes a problem statement and a solution. The problem statement explains what i needed to do, and the solution shows one possible way to solve it.

You can use these exercises to practice and improve your understanding of JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types, loops, functions, and more. You can also use them as a reference when working on your own projects.
